        <h2 class="header2" id="paragraph1">Brief Background of Myself</h2>
        <h5>Posted on 2019.06.07 11:20 am</h5>
        <p>I came to the U.S. ten years ago for college. I studied at University of Washington and graduated with a bachelar of science degree in Construction Management. When I was in college, I interned with several companies including subcontractors and vendors. Now I am working in one of the largest general contractors companies in Washington State and have accumulated over five years of experiences in construction industry. <br>
        <br>
            After I graduated, I often attended professional networking events and started making connections with people from different backgrounds and industries. Thus, I made so many friends from the events, and among them a lot work in technology industry. I was exposed to this field and every once in a while I got to hear their stories about their work and their lives. This later became one of the reasons why I want to become a programmer.

        <p>Working in construction industry for the past several years has been a very rewarding experience to me. I have participated in a project at a jobsite to see it being built from a piece of land to a brand new high school that can teach 2,000 students. I also analyzed drawings and work scopes to generate construction estimates for office and residential towers ranging from $20M to over $100M dollars.<br>
        <br>
        However, as technology progresses rapidly these days, there are more and more demands for people with technical or programming skills in most of the industries, even in construction, because <em id="quote1">technology is where the future lies.</em> This makes me believe that having programming skills is critical to advance my career and to have more career opportunities. Additionally, with a lot of friends in technology field enjoying their work and lives, I became interested and started taking online tutorials and teaching myself how to do programming.

        <h5>Posted on 2019.06.07 4:18 pm</h5>
        <p>After spending a couple of weeks learning programming online by myself, I decided to go with a more formal training to make sure I learn the basics and have a strong foundation of knowledge before I go too further. The reason that I choose to learn at Code Fellows is that it is widely acknowledged in the industry, and the certificate serves a strong proof that the person posesses competent skills and knowledge in programming. Moreover, I prefer to learn in a in-person classroom style as I find it more efficient for me to learn and get my questions answered right away.</p><br>
